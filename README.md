# How to set up a venv environment (inside the project folder)
For reference: [docs.python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

1. Clone the project on your computer.
2. Navigate to the project.
3. Run the following command to create a new environment called "venv". It's going to create a folder for your environment inside the project folder. This is already added to the gitignore file, so it's not going to be pushed to a remote repo. Note that your venv environment will be based on your "python3" version.
